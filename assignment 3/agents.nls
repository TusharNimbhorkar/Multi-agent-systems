  bus_id          ; The ID of a given agent (bus). Each agent has a unique ID.
  bus_type        ; The type of a given agent (bus). 1 means "small", 2 means "medium" and 3 means "large".
    
  ; Dynamic, read-only variables. These values may change over time. You can read them, but you cannot change them.
  inbox           ; List containing all the incoming messages (a given message is a list like this [tick sender message]).
  bus_passengers  ; List containing all the passengers that the agent (bus) is currently carrying (represented as a list like this [passenger_id bus_stop]).
  previous_stop   ; ID of the last bus stop that the agent (bus) visited (-1 means that the agent has not visited any bus stop yet).
  current_stop    ; ID of the bus stop where the agent (bus) currently is (-1 means that the agent is not at any bus stop).
  next_stop       ; ID of the bus stop the agent (bus) is traveling to (-1 means that the agent is not travelling to any bus stop).
